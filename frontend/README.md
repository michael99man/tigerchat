## Inspiration
Whether you're new to campus or a senior about to graduate, Tigerchat encourages everyone to forge new connections with other members of the Princeton community. We created Tigerchat to help you make the most of the incredible network you have at university; it's a non-judgemental platform where you can meet peers, make new friends, and chat about the going-on's in a safe and secure way.

## What it does
Tigerchat allows you to meet other Princeton students under the condition of anonymity on a text-based platform. You can match by interest, chat with no pressure, and if you wish, reveal your identity or log out.

## How we built it
We used Socket.io to build the chat platform, along with React.js. The front end is a mix of HTML/CSS. 

## Challenges we ran into
While at times we struggled with some new front end features, the main challenges we ran into were problems around app design. How exactly should individuals be matched? What about rematches? How should we monitor inappropriate conversations if we're advocating for a private platform? 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Created a platform to connect students with one another with features like app notifications on your tab, leave conversation, reveal identity, well-designed chat box. In addition, we created logos and designs to add some dynamism to our front page.

## What we learned
How to navigate front end design with React and back end using Socket.io. Also got a better understanding of how to construct an application all the way through.

## What's next for Tigerchat
CAS authentication to limit to Princeton users, reporting form for inappropriate content, and additional iterations on our chat design
